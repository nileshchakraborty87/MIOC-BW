This is an authentication system taking users' response in black and white color. For each PIN digit (considering PIN length 4), a user needs to submit the response four times. 
For a four-length PIN, total 4 * 4 = 16 rounds, will complete the authentication procedure.
In each round, a user needs to identify the color (between black and white) to which her PIN digit belongs. Then the user needs to click on the corresponding color button. 
For example, for a PIN digit 7, if a user finds that 7 belongs to black color then she will click on the black button.
